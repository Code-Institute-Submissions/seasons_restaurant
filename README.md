Seasons Restaurant


My name is Liovirgilda Mendonca, and for this user-centric project, I have decided to build a restaurant website 
since I have been working in a restaurant for over a year.


UX


From a user point of view, this website allows them to:
    
    i. View the menu online, so they have the opportunity to know what the restaurant offers beforehand;
    ii. Make an online booking, so they guarantee they will have a table at their chosen time;
    iii. View a list of upcoming events taking place at the restaurant, so they can book tickets in advance;
    iv. Get to know the history of the restaurant and their main members;
    v. Get in touch with the restaurant, so that they can receive extra information given by a member of the staff.

Features

i. Allows a user to view the menu online ;
          
ii. The home.html page has :
        1- An iframe Booking system that allows a user to book a table;
        2 - A bootstrap slide showing the next three artists performing at the restaurant;
        3 - A pitch to convince the user to explore our menu.

!!! Attention: 

I have not created the iframe Booking system present on my website. 
The OpenTable iframe was taken from "Dinner by Heston Blumenthal" website!

!!!


iii. The events.html page shows a list of the upcoming events taking place at the restaurant.
        Each bootstrap card displays information regarding the date of the event as well as the Artist's name and picture.

iv. The aboutus.html page uses Bootstrap Grid system to provide historical information about the restaurant and the staff.
    
v. The contactus.html page allows a user to get in contact with the restaurant by displaying:
    1 - A Bootstrap Contact Form filled with placeholders to help the user fill up the form; 
    2 - The restaurant address and contact number.
