Seasons Restaurant

My name is Liovirgilda Mendonca and I have decided to create a restaurant website since I have been working in a restaurant for over a year.


UX

From a user point of view, this website allows them to:
    
    i. View the menu online, so they have the opportunity to know what the restaurant offers beforehand;
    ii. Book a table online, so they guarantee they will have a table at their chosen time;
    iii. View a list of upcoming events taking place at the restaurant, so they can book tickets in advance;
    iv. Get to know the history of the restaurant and their main members;
    v. Get in touch with the restaurant, so they can receive extra information given by a member of the staff.
    

Features

i. Allows a user to view the menu online ;
          
ii. iframe Booking system - Allows a user to book a table;

!!! Attention: I have not created the iframe Booking system present in my website. The openTable iframe was taken from "Dinner by Heston Blumenthal" website!!!!
